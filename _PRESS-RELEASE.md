There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Problem ##
Meet Elise.

Elise is a 60-year-old grandmother suffering from a variety of medical conditions. She sees a cardiologist for her high blood pressure, an orthopedic surgeon for her hip replacement, a dermatologist for her psoriasis, and a general practitioner (GP) for everything else. Elise must remember to take countless pills each week, each at different times during the day, different days throughout the week, some with food, some without.

On top of this, when Elise has any symptom, she must first see her GP. For a patient of Elise’s age, the vast majority of these consultations result in a referral to one her specialists. But since Elise may not know what doctor she should contact, she is forced to see her GP, resulting in unnecessary costs and time.

## Solution ##
Enter OneCare — one place to manage all of Elise’s healthcare needs.

With OneCare, Elise can input what prescriptions she’s taking and their respective schedules. The app will then alert Elise when it’s time to take her medication and enable her to search for any information about the conditions these drugs are treating and their possible side effects.

When Elise starts feeling ill, she can input her symptoms into OneCare and the app will recommend which of her physicians she should consult. With OneCare, Elise can avoid these costly, unnecessary stops at her GP.
